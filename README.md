Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist UVW College in identifying potential students by analyzing Census Bureau data. We focus on variables like age, gender, education, and occupation to find patterns related to individuals earning more or less than $50,000. This analysis helps tailor marketing strategies to specific demographics, aiming to increase enrollment.

Customer Ask
UVW College seeks to understand demographic factors determining individual incomes to refine their marketing efforts for degree programs. Our analysis centers on individuals earning around $50,000, examining their age, gender, education status, marital status, occupation, and more.

Assumptions
We assume $50,000 as a pivotal salary figure for analysis, focusing exclusively on Census Bureau data provided by XYZ company.

Methodology
Initial data exploration was followed by detailed visualization of variables against income levels, specifically looking for patterns in demographics earning below and above $50,000.

Key Findings & Visualizations
Our analysis highlighted several demographic characteristics significantly associated with income levels, such as:

Age and income distribution
The impact of education level on income
The correlation between marital status and income
Occupation types and income levels
Gender distribution across income categories
Conclusions
Identified demographics can be effectively targeted in marketing campaigns to increase enrollment, with special focus on younger individuals, specific education levels, and marital statuses correlating with income levels below $50,000.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Reflections and Future Work
While this project focused on exploratory data analysis and visualization, future work could include developing a predictive model to more accurately identify potential students based on demographic data.
